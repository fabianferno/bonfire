# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repo shape

The repo is a single TypeScript service plus product docs. Everything buildable lives in [agent/](agent/) — work from there. Top-level files ([prd.md](prd.md), [agent-prd.md](agent-prd.md), [resources.md](resources.md), [judging-criteria.md](judging-criteria.md), [docs/superpowers/plans/](docs/superpowers/plans/)) are product/design context for the hackathon submission, not code.

`bonfire` is the umbrella product; `ember-agent` (in `agent/`) is the standalone agent runtime that BonFire wraps. The agent service is intentionally self-contained and Dockerizable — assume one agent per directory, no multi-tenant logic.

## Commands

All commands run from [agent/](agent/) (Node ≥ 20, pnpm):

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev            # tsx watch on src/index.ts, boots examples/default-agent
pnpm build          # tsc -> dist/
pnpm start          # node dist/index.js (expects an agent dir as $AGENT_DIR or argv[2])
pnpm typecheck      # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test           # vitest run
pnpm test:watch
pnpm test -- test/runtime.test.ts            # single file
pnpm test -- -t "handles a message"          # by test name
```

Docker (from `agent/docker/`): `docker compose up --build` — builds the image, mounts `examples/default-agent` at `/agent`, exposes `:7777`. The Dockerfile's ENTRYPOINT is hardcoded to `node dist/index.js /agent`.

`.env` lives at `agent/.env` (see `.env.example`). The compose file reads `../.env`, so the same file works for both `pnpm dev` and Docker.

## Architecture

### Boot flow ([src/index.ts](agent/src/index.ts))

`main()` resolves an **agent directory** (argv[2] / `$AGENT_DIR` / `./examples/default-agent`) and wires everything against that directory — not the cwd. The agent directory is the unit of configuration; it contains `agent.config.json`, `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `mcp.json`, and `skills/`. Treat `agentDir` as the only filesystem root the runtime should touch — paths outside it must go through [src/util/paths.ts](agent/src/util/paths.ts)'s `assertInside`.

Boot order matters: load config → bootstrap `/learn` skill → load filesystem skills (and start watcher) → start MCP child processes → create LLM client (may do network/on-chain work for 0G) → open `MemoryStore` (SQLite + sqlite-vec) → construct `AgentRuntime` → start channel adapters (web, telegram) → start evolution loop → start HTTP API. SIGTERM/SIGINT teardown reverses this.

### LLM provider abstraction ([src/runtime/llm-client.ts](agent/src/runtime/llm-client.ts))

Two providers, one `LanguageModelV1` surface from Vercel AI SDK:

- **`openai-compatible`** — any OpenAI-shaped chat endpoint. Reads `LLM_API_KEY` (env var name is configurable per agent via `llm.apiKeyEnv`).
- **`zerog`** — 0G Compute network. Constructs an `ethers.Wallet` from `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`, instantiates `@0glabs/0g-serving-broker`, ensures a ledger exists (auto-funds 0.05 OG), lists chat services, picks one (honoring `OG_BROKER_PROVIDER` preference and `llm.model` pin), and wraps the OpenAI-compatible adapter with a custom `fetch` that injects per-request signed headers from `broker.inference.getRequestHeaders()`. The broker SDK is CommonJS — loaded via `createRequire` to avoid ESM interop bugs.

When adding LLM features, write against `LanguageModelV1` from `ai` — never branch on provider. Provider differences end at this file.

### Prompt composition ([src/runtime/prompt-builder.ts](agent/src/runtime/prompt-builder.ts))

The system prompt is assembled from four sources, in this XML structure: `<soul>` (from `SOUL.md` — voice/personality) + `<operating_rules>` (from `AGENTS.md` — must/must-not rules) + `<available_skills>` (loaded skills, name+description+path) + `<memory_context>` (top-k vector hits for the current message). SOUL and AGENTS are deliberately split — keep edits in the right file. Do not merge them.

### Message lifecycle ([src/runtime/agent.ts](agent/src/runtime/agent.ts))

`AgentRuntime.handle(InboundMessage)`:
1. `SessionManager.load({channel, chatId})` — gets or creates a session row keyed by `(channel, chat_id, topic)`; loads recent message history.
2. If embeddings configured, embed the user text and pull top-5 vector hits → `memorySnippets`.
3. Build system prompt; call `generateText` with `maxSteps: 8` (tool-use loop).
4. Reply via the channel's `msg.reply()`; append user+assistant turns to SQLite; re-embed the exchange and index it.
5. `maybeCompact` deletes oldest messages when token usage crosses `memory.compactAfterTokens` and the row count exceeds 40.

Channels (`web`, `telegram`) implement the `ChannelAdapter` interface in [src/channels/base.ts](agent/src/channels/base.ts) and converge on the same `InboundMessage` shape — `reply` is a function the channel provides. The web adapter is also the SSE bus for `/chat/stream/:id`.

### Skills ([src/skills/](agent/src/skills/))

A skill is `<agentDir>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, optional `metadata.openclaw.*` for gating). Loader strips an optional `--- agentskill.sh ---` block above the frontmatter that carries registry provenance (`owner`, `slug`, `contentSha`). `chokidar` watches the skills dir and triggers a full reload on any change — the loader is idempotent, so just re-running it is the refresh.

`installSkill` (in [installer.ts](agent/src/skills/installer.ts)) routes through one of three registry clients (`agentskill.sh`, `clawhub`, `url`), runs `scanner.scanContent` on the resulting `SKILL.md`, and **deletes the install on any critical finding**. `auto-safe` evolution mode additionally rejects skills declaring `requires.bins`.

`removeSkill` validates the slug against `/^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$/` *and* runs `assertInside(skillsRoot, slug)` before `rm -rf`. **Any new code that resolves user-supplied paths under `agentDir` must go through `assertInside`** — `realpath`-based, tolerates non-existent targets, blocks symlink escape.

On first boot, `ensureLearnSkill` clones the `agentskill.sh/ags` repo into `skills/learn/` (falls back to a single-file HTTPS fetch of `SKILL.md` if git fails). This is what lets the agent install other skills via natural language.

### Evolution loop ([src/evolution/loop.ts](agent/src/evolution/loop.ts))

Periodically (every `evolution.intervalHours`) calls `discover(interests)` against `agentskill.sh`, scores candidates with the LLM (0-10 JSON output), then either emits a `evolution.suggest` event on the bus (`mode: suggest`) or auto-installs (`auto-safe` requires `securityScore >= 80`, `auto-all` requires `>= 50`). `auto-all` is documented as supply-chain-risky — default is `suggest`.

### HTTP API ([src/api/](agent/src/api/))

Hono app composed from feature routers in `src/api/routes/*.ts`. No auth — the README explicitly states "assume network isolation; BonFire adds auth at its layer." Don't add auth here; add it in the wrapping product.

The chat UI is a single static file at [agent/public/chat.html](agent/public/chat.html) served verbatim by `GET /chat`. It is intentionally hand-editable — don't replace it with a build pipeline.

### Memory store ([src/memory/store.ts](agent/src/memory/store.ts))

`better-sqlite3` + `sqlite-vec` virtual table at 1536 dimensions. Schema: `sessions`, `messages`, `vectors` (vec0), `vector_meta`. Vector dim is hardcoded — if you change the embeddings model dimension, change the constructor default and migrate the DB.

## Conventions

- **ESM throughout.** Imports use `.js` extensions even for `.ts` source — required for Node's NodeNext module resolution. Don't drop them.
- **Logging:** use `log` from [src/util/logger.ts](agent/src/util/logger.ts). It's a `pino` instance with redaction rules for `token`, `apiKey`, `botToken`, and auth headers — extend `redact.paths` when adding new sensitive fields rather than logging selectively.
- **Validation at the edge:** every external input (config files, `mcp.json`, HTTP `PATCH /config` bodies) is parsed through a Zod schema in [src/config/schema.ts](agent/src/config/schema.ts). Internal code trusts `AgentConfig` as the parsed type.
- **No package-manager mixing:** this is a pnpm project (`pnpm-lock.yaml`). Don't run `npm install` or `yarn`.

## Tests

Vitest, Node environment, 10s timeout. Tests live in [agent/test/](agent/test/) and use [agent/test/fixtures/test-agent/](agent/test/fixtures/test-agent/) for any test that needs an agent directory. `runtime.test.ts` exercises the full message loop against `MockLanguageModelV1` from `ai/test` — copy that pattern when adding runtime tests; don't mock at the `generateText` level.

Temp SQLite files (`test/.tmp-*.db`) are gitignored — clean them up with `fs.unlinkSync` in the test before opening the store (see `runtime.test.ts`).
